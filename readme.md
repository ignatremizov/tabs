# Ignat's copy of TK's Tree Style Tab Outliner

![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-17%25-yellow.svg)

Windows, tabs, bookmarks, notes, and more... all mixed together in one place,
a highly structured living document that you and your browsers build together
to organize your online life.

It can also sync real-time-ish across all your browsers, to make sure you
always have what you need -- even if they're *different* browsers.  Close your
session in Chrome, then start up Firefox or Brave or whatever, and continue
that same session where you left off.  And you control your data -- nothing is
sent to corporate clouds, only to a server of your choice.  Self-hosting is
recommended for maximum privacy.

This extension makes many of the browser's built-in functions wholly or at
least partially obsolete -- bookmarks, session management, vertical tabs,
read-later, notes, pinned tabs, stacked tabs, AI tab organizers, etc.  You
could still use those things, but why bother when you have something better?


## Tests & Coverage

Browser tests live in `tests/*.test.html` and can be opened via `make test`.
Coverage is collected via `make coverage`, which runs:
- Node-based unit tests
- Headless Chrome tests for the browser pages (both `?env=chrome` and `?env=firefox`)

The coverage % is line-based and updates the README badge automatically after
`make coverage`. If Chrome isn’t on PATH, set `CHROME_BIN=/path/to/chrome`.


## Background / Inspiration

I used Tabs Outliner for a long time.  It was great.  But it was missing some
important things, and it has been increasingly buggy over time from poor
maintenance, and it's proprietary so I can't fix it.

I also tried to use Tree Style Tab in Firefox, but even with multiple add-ons
to enhance it, it just can't do what I wanted.  And I tried several others, but
none really hit the mark.

So I decided to replace Tabs Outliner with something brand new.

And while I'm at it, I can finally add all the stuff I wanted it to have.


## Improvements over Tabs Outliner

The biggest upgrades are pretty broad:

- It should be **free and open-source**.  That is the only way to build tech
  which stands the test of time.  No crippled "free" version to convince people
  to buy the real thing.  Donations are GREATLY appreciated though, since
  I need to buy groceries and pay rent in order to keep working on this.
- I want the tree **continuously backed up**.  If I lose a hard drive again,
  that should *not* make me lose my browser session, notes, etc.
- It should **back up to a server the user owns and controls**.  It should not
  depend on a rent-seeking, privacy-violating corporate cloud.
- I want **all my browsers to share the same tree**.  Having separate trees and
  sessions for each browser is a huge pain.
- I don't want to be locked into using Chrome.  It should **support more than
  one browser**.  Sync between Chromium, Firefox, Vivaldi, Edge, Brave, ...
  whatever.  Vendor lock-in sucks, especially with the major players all racing
  to fill their browser with AI to analyze everything you do online.
- I want to be able to **easily export the tree in standard formats** like
  json, markdown, and plain text.

It should also have lots of other features which are missing in Tabs Outliner:

- Sidebar mode (and "just this window" mode, while running as a sidebar)
- Even more compact layout than Tabs Outliner, to make it fit better in
  a narrow sidepanel
- Snapshots and revision history so you can undo mistakes, restore old sessions
  easily, see how things changed over time, etc.  And on that note...
- Undo
- Checklists / tasks
- Search
- Sort
- Longer notes when desired
- Configurable hotkeys, both while focused and while browsing
- Batch operations on marked items
- Ability to easily move sets of nodes between windows without a mouse or
  opening a "full tree" view (mark nodes in one window, switch to other window,
  then paste the marked nodes to move them)
- Optional behavior to open a new window when moving a subtree to the top level
  (moves the window container instead when you move the only child of a window)
- Hover-menu "W" converts labels to windows, wraps tabs into windows, and can
  convert windows back into labels
- Open new blank tabs next to the current tab
- Option to disable automatic tab reordering if the browser already places new
  tabs next to the current tab
- User's choice of several themes, and ability to add more
- Better handling of crashes and restarts... no huge trees full of old crashed
  windows to manually recover and de-dupe
- Better tools to find and remove duplicates, especially for users who are
  importing their old sessions
- Bigger drop zones so the user doesn't have to be so precise during
  drag-n-drop
- Better visual indication for where the open tabs are in a massive tree
- Proper Manifest V3 support so it doesn't need to be manually restarted all
  the time
- More generally, fixes a wide range of bugs which Tabs Outliner had


## Dependencies

Client dependencies: None.  Only your browser.  However, it does need to be
recent enough to support the sidepanel feature.

Client build dependencies:  Not much.  Get (or git) a copy of the source.  For
Chrome, that alone is sufficient.  For Firefox, you'll also need a command
line, the "make" program, and the "zip" program.

Javascript dependencies are their own circle of hell, so this is built using
just vanilla javascript with no outside dependencies at all.

Server dependencies: TBD.  Probably Python and FastAPI.


## Installation

Install from your browser's app store, ideally.  It boosts the numbers in the
app store and helps this extension gain more visibility.  It also allows easier
updates, in case you want updates when a new version is released.

However, installing from source is possible too:

### Chrome

In Chromium-based browsers:

- Enable "developer mode" in the browser's extensions page.
- `git clone --tags https://github.com/ignatremizov/tabs.git`
- `cd tabs`
- `make chrome-dir`
- Use "load unpacked extension" in the browser, to load the copy in
  `dist/chromium`.

This process mostly just copies all the files into `active/`.  If you set
`EXT_NAME` in `.env`, the build step will override the manifest name.

Upstream: https://github.com/ToyKeeper/tktsto

### Firefox

In Firefox, it's necessary to sign the extension because most 2025-and-later
versions won't run unsigned extensions even if you configure it to not require
signatures.  If you're lucky enough to be able to run unsigned extensions, then
just run `make` to generate a compatible .zip file, and load it from the
`dist/` dir.  You can still load a temporary unsigned extension via
`about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.  Otherwise, try the following...

Create an account and API keys at https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/
(under "API Keys").

Create a `.env` file containing a few settings:

```sh
# get these from your account at addons.mozilla.org/developers
JWT_ISSUER=user:XXXXXXXX:XXX
JWT_SECRET=your_amo_api_secret

# set your own extension ID and name here
EXT_NAME="TK Tree Style Tab Outliner (My Name's personal build)"
FF_EXT_ID="your-email-address+tktsto@your-email-domain.com"
```

Run `make firefox-sign`.

Install the `.xpi` file.

### Server

  **Note:** Firefox builds require version 142+ due to the mandatory
  `data_collection_permissions` field (required for Firefox desktop 140+ and
  Firefox for Android 142+). The extension declares it collects no data.

To create a signed Firefox `.xpi` (for non-temporary installs), you need AMO
API credentials:

- Create API keys at https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/ ("API Keys").
- Put them in `.env` as `JWT_ISSUER` and `JWT_SECRET`.
- Run `make firefox-sign`.

FUTURE: I also recommend installing [the backup/sync server](server/readme.md),
so you can automatically save snapshots of your session, sync your session
between multiple devices, convert the snapshots to other formats, and archive
old data that you don't need in the tree any more.


## Testing

Unit tests are located in the `tests/` directory. To run them:

```bash
make test
```

`make test` starts a local HTTP server and opens the test pages. This matters for module-based tests (like `tests/tree-node.test.html`) which won't run from `file://`.

You can also open individual tests:
- `http://127.0.0.1:8765/tests/dom-safety.test.html`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8765/tests/tree-node.test.html` (use `?env=firefox` or `?env=chrome` to force rules)

Tests use a simple browser-based framework with no external dependencies,
following the project's vanilla JavaScript philosophy.

## AI-assisted contributions

AI assistance is allowed, with contributor responsibility for review, testing,
and licensing.  See [AI Contribution Policy](AI_POLICY.md) for details.


## Usage

The extension should show a tutorial thingy after being installed for the first
time.  You can also access the tutorial again later by pressing "?" in the tree
view while it has focus.  Or there's the "Help" button for full documentation.


## Initial setup / configuration

Basic setup:

- Click the "Options" button to get the config settings.
- Set a client name (non-alphanumeric characters are removed automatically).
- Configure automatic backups.
- Choose a theme, and any other options you'd like.
- If your browser already opens new tabs next to the current tab, you can turn
  off automatic tab reordering in Options so the tree mirrors the browser’s tab
  order.
- Go through the tutorial.  It should have been generated as a set of nodes in
  the tree when you installed the extension.

FUTURE: I strongly recommend installing and using the provided backup/sync
server, so you can automatically save snapshots of your session and sync
between browsers.  This is covered in [the server's readme
file](server/readme.md).

Then maybe go into the "Extension hotkeys" page of your browser to configure
global command hotkeys.

- Firefox: Go to `about:addons`, then click the gear icon, then "Manage
  Extension Shortcuts".
- Chrome: `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`
- Edge: `edge://extensions/shortcuts`
- Brave: `brave://extensions/shortcuts`
- Vivaldi: `vivaldi:extensions` then "Keyboard shortcuts".

The browser doesn't allow extensions to define more than 4 recommended global
hotkeys.  So you should set those up.  I recommend assigning keys which match
the key bindings for the sidepanel's normal usage, like when it has keyboard
focus...  but add "Alt" to each one so you can perform those same functions
without having to focus the sidepanel first.

For example, when the sidepanel is focused, some of the default hotkeys
include...

- `u`: unload the highlighted node (if collapsed, unloads all child tabs)
- `Enter`: load the highlighted node (if collapsed, loads all child tabs)
- `Up` / `Down`: move the cursor
- `Shift+Up` / `Shift+Down`: move the node the cursor is on
- `Space`: expand/collapse the highlighted node

When using keyboard shortcuts on a **collapsed node with children**, the
load/unload actions will apply to all tabs in that branch.  A confirmation
dialog will appear to prevent accidental batch operations.  Mouse clicks on the
hover menu buttons skip the confirmation for a faster workflow.

So in your extension hotkeys, I'd recommend assigning them like this:

- `Alt+u`: unload the current tab
- `Alt+Enter`: load the highlighted node
- `Alt+Up` / `Alt+Down`: move the cursor
- `Alt+Shift+Up` / `Alt+Shift+Down`: move the node the cursor is on
- `Alt+Space`: expand/collapse the highlighted node

Just take the regular key and add "Alt".  Do this for every function you think
you'll want to use during normal browsing without having to focus the sidepanel
first.

## Tips / Best practices

Name your windows!

Put most of your per-window sidebars in "Window" mode, so it'll only show the
tabs and notes in that specific window.  "Session" mode is only needed
occasionally, for doing things like loading a saved window.

Unload the tabs you don't immediately need.  They'll still be available later
when you have time for them.  Instead of keeping a tab open for weeks or months
until you have time to do it... add a quick note about why it was open, what
action it needs from you, then unload it.  Much easier than devoting space in
your head, your RAM, and your tab bar.

Zoom the sidebar to a comfortable size:

- Chrome: Click the "Options" button in the sidebar, then use Chrome's normal
  zoom functions in the options page.  It should zoom the sidebar too.  Try
  Ctrl+Mousewheel, or Ctrl with "=" or "-".

- Firefox: Focus the sidebar by clicking in it, then use Ctrl+Mousewheel to
  zoom the sidebar.

When moving stuff between windows, I recommend marking the items in one window,
then switching to a different window and pasting the items.  I find this much
easier than trying to drag stuff around with a mouse.

### Window wrapping

Use the hover-menu "W" button to wrap a node in a window, convert a label into
a window, or convert a window back into a label.  This is useful for grouping
related tabs together without opening a new browser window until you actually
load a tab.  The "D" delete action has extra window-aware behavior:
expanded loaded windows unload (close the window) but keep tabs in the tree as
wasLoaded.  Collapsed loaded windows prompt before closing and deleting tabs.
If the window has ancestor windows, delete will keep loaded tabs by merging
into the nearest ancestor window, creating one if not found.  Deleting an
unloaded window simply unwraps it.

If a label is converted to a window and it contains open tabs, those tabs are
moved into the new window automatically.  Converting a loaded window back into
a label will preserve the window as a child node, so its open tabs stay open.

When loading a tab from the root without any window ancestor, the behavior can
be tuned in Options to wrap either just the selected node or the top-most
ungrouped ancestor (including labels).

### Organization

Put the most important and most recent items near the top of whatever branch
they are in.  The farther down you go, the older and less important the items
should be.  This also keeps the most important tabs near the left edge of the
window.

Treat every item in your tree as a "todo list" item, even if it doesn't have
a checkbox.  Then when you are done with a task, done with a tab or a note or
an entire branch... move it so it's hidden inside of a heading like "Done" or
"Old".  This keeps your main view less cluttered so you can focus more easily.

Every once in a while, archive the contents of your "Old" or "Done" branches.
Drag the branch into a separate program to export it as markdown, then remove
from the tree.  Or take a snapshot or backup file, convert it to your favorite
format, and make a separate copy which only contains those old branches.  Then
remove them from your active tree.  This helps keep your session quick and
responsive, instead of gradually getting slower as you accumulate more and more
old junk.

Specifically, I'd recommend moving your old nodes in a manner which organizes
them by date, and then maybe once a year, archive anything which is more than
a year old.  Try a structure like this...

- Done / Old / Cancelled
  - 2025 (or whatever the current year is)
    - (this is where you put nodes and branches as you finish them)
  - 2024
    - (this holds last year's nodes, for easy reference)
  - 2023 (empty, only one node)
    - (archived to ~/tabs/2023/archived.md)
  - 2022 (empty, only one node)
    - (archived to ~/tabs/2022/archived.md)

For task / checkbox nodes, I recommend a few generic task states:

- `[ ]`: todo / incomplete (space or underscore or dash)
- `[+]`: partially done / half complete (counts as `50%`)
- `[X]`: done / completed  (or `[*]` works too)
- `[F]`: failed
- `[S]`: skipped
- `[!]`: important
- `[?]`: unknown / unsure
- `[%]`: displays completion percent of child nodes

But you're free to assign task states however you like, for whatever your
workflow requires.  You can use any type-able letter, number, or punctuation as
a task state... and assign your own meaning to it.

### How to implement a personal kanban for tabs in your sidebar

For detailed statuses and complex workflows, I recommend putting nodes inside
of a heading which indicates the type of action needed, and then letting nodes
flow through the process you created.  For example:

- Work
  - Messages
    - Unread
    - To reply
    - Waiting for reply
    - Funny stuff Dave said
    - Done
  - Bugs
    - New
    - Needs triage
    - Waiting on more info
    - Needs testing
    - Worked on this week, re-evaluate next week
    - Ping if not updated by end of month
    - Fixed but needs regression tests added
    - Done
  - Meetings
    - Upcoming
    - Recurring
    - Done

Then when you reply to a "To reply" message, move it to "Waiting for reply" or
"Done".  It doesn't really need a checkbox... it just needs to move from one
list to another when the status changes.

### Daily todo list / log / calendar

Here's a neat way to track your tasks and progress and stuff on a daily basis.
Create a node called 'Daily', then inside that, add more headings for year,
month, day, and tasks and details for each day.

- Daily
  - 2025
    - 04
      - 04
        - `[F]` 404 brain not found, stayed up too late and barely slept
      - 03
        - `[ ]` pay bills
        - `[+]` myproject: add feature X
        - `[X]` laundry
        - `[X]` exercise
        - `[X]` 19:00 game night w/ friends
      - 02
        - `[X]` shower
        - `[X]` groceries
        - `[X]` myproject: add feature Z
        - `[ ]` myproject: add feature X
        - `[F]` Dave called, and I spent the day dealing with his problems
        - `[ ]` exercise
        - `[ ]` pay bills
      - 01
        - `[X]` April Fools Day, take a day off
        - `[X]` get a pizza and hide from the world
        - `[X]` anime


## FAQ

**What's Tiki Tiestio?**  It's just a cute way to say "TKTSTO".

**Where are my bookmarks?**  This extension does not touch your browser's
built-in bookmarks.  It is completely separate, and makes the legacy bookmark
system mostly pointless.


## Links

The main project links are redirect URLs -- to make the links easier to
remember, to reduce reliance on corporate cloud services, and to reduce
disruption in case the links ever need to change.  For example, if code hosting
ever moves from GitHub to another site, the links below should still point at
the current project hosting site:

- Code / Development: https://toykeeper.net/tktsto
- Releases: https://toykeeper.net/tktsto/releases
- Change Log: https://toykeeper.net/tktsto/changelog
- Documentation: https://toykeeper.net/tktsto/docs
- Chat / Discord Invite: https://toykeeper.net/tktsto/chat
- Donate / Patreon: https://toykeeper.net/tktsto/donate

Installing the extension from source or from web extension stores:
